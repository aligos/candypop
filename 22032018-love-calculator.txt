Starup IDEA

making love calculator
input the girl response to the app, and predict how much she like or love you.
the app will suggest you the best decision or another option, to get her or leave her.

It's smartest makcomblang app.

example:
You: Good morning!
Her: ... (Not answering)

How can the app predict if she's like or not?
I guess you now if she's not like you, if the app run like this, I think it's useless
try another action, don't just using chat app or direct chat.
try to comment her instagram story or picture,

another example:
Her: Uploading new picture(instastory), tell about she's doing something about thesis.
You: Good Luck!
Her: Thanks :) (with smile emoticon)

How the app can predict this converstation?
how about imageRecognition, you download picture or instastory upload it to the app
the app suggest you how to comment on it.
you do that, input the response
and what the answer?
I think the answer is defend on what you said to her.
If you just say "Good Luck" or something like this, the answer will be "thanks" even if she's not like you
Wait, don't feel bad. I think the app will recognize what emoticon you have from her.
So this will be meaning something.

How do you think Lerry?
